function H-snakeReparam4e
%function [xp,yp] = snakeReparam4e(x,y) 
%   [XP,YP] = SNAKEREPARAM4E(X,Y) reparameterizes snake coordinates
%   [X,Y] by redistributing the points so that they are spaced
%   uniformly in terms of arc length. The number of points in the
%   output [XP,YP] is the same as in the input {X,Y]. It is
%   assumed that the snake is a closed planar curve.
